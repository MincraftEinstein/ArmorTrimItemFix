### **üìò Description**
Trimmed armor items in Minecraft display one of four generic trim textures for every item, no matter what trim you
put on an item the texture is always the same. This mod fixes that by adding more item trim textures that
change depending on the trim applied

[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) required for the Fabric version

Supports [More Armor Trims](https://modrinth.com/mod/more-armor-trims)
